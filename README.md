# CS465-FullStack
CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

Develop a security protocol by adding a single layer of security to the SPA admin side, including an HTML login form for the admin site and logic to secure the administrative endpoint methods.
Test the security protocol by testing the authentication with mock data and verify the new user-class API endpoints using Postman.
Incorporate the security protocol by refactoring the front-end and back-end websites.
Test the front-end website by logging in to ensure CRUD features are enabled.
